#Delnet Description:
Delnet is web application of supportive control environment for machine-learning developers.<br /> 
The application's main goal is to help developers design and construct machine learning projects and to make the laborious process easier and<br /> faster.<br />
The application provides a plethora of features and tools which simplify the build-up process, promote the project and help the project managers to achieve their goals to design an optimal model for their tasks.<br />
For instance the application offers detailed analysis on your model performance along with valuable advices and explanations.<br /><br />

Delnet is community based application which provides ongoing community supports through building datasets in collaboration or consult about any<br /> encountered issues and faults.<br />
The users encouraged to help each other in project development<br />
They are able to publish their dataset, share knowledge, get answers for their questions, brush up their ml-knowledge and stay aligned with the<br /> latest trends or ideas.<br />
This collaborative procedure can help users to work more effectively.<br /><br />
**Target clients:<br />

The clients are machine-learning developers and students who are interested in friendly and supportive environment or just people that want to<br /> enrich and share their knowledge through articles, videos and posts on this topic.<br />

Additionally the application is for people who are not well-versed with coding since the application provided an automated machine-learning build-<br />up through friendly and pleasant interface without requiring expertise in coding.<br /><br />

Innovation:<br />
Delnet web application is innovative and different from other applications of machine-learning field.<br />
The application combines many features that brought together to serve deep-learning developers and used as helping hand and enable users to build top-notch models.<br />
Through presentation of model results with charts and diagrams, analysis of the project components, automated machine-learning model builder and<br /> ability to build high-scale datasets.<br />
This combination provides an advanced and community-based supportive and friendly environment that does not exist in other.<br />
**Project Scope:
The application composed of multiple components:

1. Collection of features which provides a helping hand in design and construction of ml project such as:
•	Run your classifier within a few clicks on the server
•	Tune hyper-parameters and find the optimal way to configure your model.
•	Offer detailed analysis on your model performance along with valuable advices and explanations.
•	Display detailed running features and outcomes in a pleasant and neat manner through charts, graphs and tables.
•	Running tests 
•	Display visually the model design and architecture along with how each layer has configured
•	Deploy and use your own model 
And more

2. Project management: the application provides several tools to manage your project in efficient way:
•	Manage your team and provides permissions for each team member
•	Automated and manual notifications which apprises the team members about latest activity or modifications
•	Build check list which lay out the tasks that should be completed as part of the project which defines what needs to be done and by whom.
The manager is able manage the tasks and to divide the workload between the team members.

3. Datasets Management:
A crucial part of deep learning projects is collecting the data to train the model on. The application offers an extensive and friendly interface to collect and manage the data. 
o	Enable users to define set of labels or classes and insert samples to the dataset in pleasant and comfortable way
o	Enable users to collect the data in collaboration
o	Enable users to share and publish their datasets
o	Enable users to find and use datasets that fits their task.
o	The application offers examples to add to your set
o	Allow to collect untagged data that will be later tagged by dataset team.
o	Provides dataset analysis i.e. to determine whether the dataset is balanced, well-distributed and large enough for the classification task.
Using these features, it easy to establish rich and stable data set with less effort.

4. Community: the application characterized by virtual bond between users where they can help and support each other in project development.
o	The users are able to share knowledge, videos, articles and posts.
o	The users gain high-quality information, they can brush up their knowledge and stay aligned with latest ideas.
o	Users can get answers for their questions or any issue they encountered during model implementation.
o	Users are able to contact with others privately and consult with each other.
o	The posts are arranged by subdomains in organized manner.

5. Automated model build-up: provides a tool that making deep learning more accessible and enables users to build deep learning models without requiring expertise in coding.
Users who are not well-versed with coding can build up their own model.<br />
